---

## Google Drive Integration

### Note:
The system is designed to support modular backends in the future using an abstracted StorageController.

Google Drive integration is essential for data persistence and synchronization across devices.

### Setting Up Google Cloud Project

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Click "Create Project"
   - Enter a project name (e.g., "JCC Stockroom")
   - Click "Create"

2. **Enable Google Drive API**
   - In your project, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Drive API"
   - Click on the result and click "Enable"

3. **Create OAuth Credentials**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Web application" as the application type
   - Enter a name (e.g., "JCC Stockroom Web Client")
   - Add authorized JavaScript origins:
     - Your application URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.com`)
     - For local testing: `http://localhost:8000` (adjust port as needed)
   - Click "Create"
   - Note the Client ID (you'll need it for the application)

### Configuring JCC Stockroom for Google Drive

1. **Update Configuration File**
   - Open `scripts/storage/googleDrive.js`
   - Replace the placeholder client ID with your actual Google Client ID:
     ```javascript
     const CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID';
     ```

2. **Testing the Integration**
   - In the JCC Stockroom application, click "Connect to Google Drive"
   - You should be prompted to authorize the application
   - Follow the prompts to grant permissions
   - Verify that the connection status shows "Connected"

### Google Drive Storage Structure

When connected, JCC Stockroom creates this structure in Google Drive:

- `JCC Stockroom-Data/` (Application folder)
  - `inventory_items.json` (Inventory data)
  - `suppliers.json` (Supplier data)
  - `categories.json` (Category data)
  - `locations.json` (Location data)
  - `hot_counts.json` (Hot count history)
  - `orders.json` (Order data)
  - `app_settings.json` (Application settings)
  - `backups/` (Folder containing dated backups)

### Managing Google Drive Data

You can directly manage the data files in Google Drive when necessary:

1. **Viewing Data Files**
   - Log into Google Drive
   - Navigate to the JCC Stockroom-Data folder
   - Files are in JSON format and can be downloaded for inspection

2. **Manual Backup**
   - Copy the entire JCC Stockroom-Data folder to create a backup
   - Use meaningful names (e.g., "JCC Stockroom-Backup-2025-05-22")

3. **Data Recovery**
   - If needed, you can restore JSON files from a backup
   - Replace corrupted files with backup versions

> **Note**: Always create a backup before manually modifying any data files in Google Drive.

## User Management

### User Roles and Permissions

JCC Stockroom supports three user roles with distinct permissions:

1. **Administrator**
   - Complete access to all system functions
   - User management and system configuration
   - Data management and backup operations

2. **Inventory Manager**
   - Full access to inventory management
   - Can create and manage orders
   - Access to all reports
   - Cannot manage users or system configuration

3. **Kitchen Staff**
   - Basic inventory viewing
   - Performing hot counts
   - Limited reports access
   - Cannot create or modify orders
   - No access to system settings

### Managing User Accounts

#### Creating New Users

1. Navigate to Settings > User Management
2. Click "Add User"
3. Fill in the required information:
   - Username
   - Full Name
   - Email

#### Deactivating Users

When a user no longer needs access:

1. Navigate to Settings > User Management
2. Click on the user you want to deactivate
3. Toggle the "Active" switch to Off
4. Click "Save Changes"

> **Note**: Deactivating users preserves their account history while preventing system access. This is preferable to deletion for audit purposes.

#### Resetting Passwords

1. Navigate to Settings > User Management
2. Click on the user whose password needs reset
3. Click "Reset Password"
4. Enter a new temporary password
5. Click "Save"

## Backup and Recovery

A robust backup strategy is essential for data protection.

### Automated Backups

JCC Stockroom automatically creates backups when Google Drive integration is enabled:

1. **Daily Backups**
   - Created automatically once per day
   - Stored in the `JCC Stockroom-Data/backups/` folder
   - Named with date and time (e.g., `backup-2025-05-22-0800.json`)
   - Retains last 7 daily backups

2. **Weekly Backups**
   - Created automatically once per week
   - Stored in the same backups folder
   - Named with week number (e.g., `backup-2025-W21.json`)
   - Retains last 4 weekly backups

3. **Monthly Backups**
   - Created automatically on the 1st of each month
   - Stored in the same backups folder
   - Named with month (e.g., `backup-2025-05.json`)
   - Retains last 12 monthly backups

### Manual Backups

Create manual backups before major operations:

1. Navigate to Settings > Data Management
2. Click "Create Backup"

## Security Considerations

While JCC Stockroom is a client-side application, proper security measures are still important.

### Authentication Security

1. **Administrator Responsibilities**
   - Enforce strong password policies
   - Regularly audit user accounts
   - Promptly deactivate accounts for departed staff

2. **Google Account Security**
   - The Google account used for Drive integration should be secured with:
     - Strong password
     - Two-factor authentication
     - Regular security reviews

### Data Protection

1. **Sensitive Information Guidelines**
   - Avoid storing highly sensitive information (e.g., personal data, credit card numbers)
   - If sensitive supplier information is needed, consider using reference numbers instead of full details

2. **Access Control**
   - Use the role-based permissions system to limit access
   - Regularly review and adjust permissions

### Network Security

1. **HTTPS Requirement**
   - Always serve the application over HTTPS
   - This is mandatory for Google Drive integration
   - Helps protect data in transit

2. **Content Security Policy**
   - Consider implementing a Content Security Policy header:
     ```
     Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://*.googleapis.com; script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com https://accounts.google.com; frame-src https://accounts.google.com;
     ```

### Browser Storage Security

1. **Data Encryption**
   - By default, localStorage data is not encrypted
   - The application automatically encrypts sensitive information before storage
   - Google Drive data is protected by Google's security measures

2. **Device Security**
   - Ensure devices used to access JCC Stockroom:
     - Require login credentials
     - Lock automatically after inactivity
     - Have up-to-date browsers and operating systems

---

## Performance Optimization

Optimize system performance with these techniques:

### Browser Performance

1. **Cache Management**
   - Configure server cache headers properly:
     ```
     # Apache example (.htaccess)
     <FilesMatch "\.(js|css|jpg|png|gif)$">
       Header set Cache-Control "max-age=86400"
     </FilesMatch>
     ```
   - Periodically clear browser cache if issues arise

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - Serve minified JavaScript and CSS in production
   - Optimize images
   - Enable GZIP/Brotli compression on your server

### Data Management for Performance

1. **Large Dataset Handling**
   - For inventories exceeding 1,000 items:
     - Enable pagination in all views
     - Reduce default items per page to 25-50
     - Consider archiving rarely used items

2. **Order History Optimization**
   - For systems with extensive order history:
     - Archive orders older than 6 months
     - Export old orders to external storage

3. **Hot Counts Optimization**
   - For systems with daily hot counts:
     - Archive data older than 90 days
     - Use the data export feature for historical analysis

### Google Drive Optimization

1. **Sync Frequency**
   - Adjust sync frequency based on usage patterns:
     - High-usage environments: 15-30 minutes
     - Low-usage environments: 60+ minutes

2. **Selective Sync**
   - Enable the "Selective Sync" option in settings
   - Configure which data types sync automatically vs. on-demand
